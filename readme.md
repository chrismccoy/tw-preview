# Tailwind Previewer for WordPress

A lightweight WordPress plugin that renders raw Tailwind CSS HTML via shortcode. It features a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between a live rendered view and a syntax-highlighted source code view.

## Features

*   ⚡ **Live Tailwind Rendering:** Instantly renders utility classes using the Tailwind Play CDN.
*   🌈 **Syntax Highlighting:** Beautiful dark-mode code viewing powered by Prism.js
*   📋 **One-Click Copy:** Easily copy the clean source code to your clipboard.
*   🧹 **Smart Formatting:** Automatically strips WordPress auto-paragraph tags (`<p>` and `<br>`) for clean code output.
*   🚀 **Performance Optimized:** Assets and scripts only load on pages where the shortcode is used.
